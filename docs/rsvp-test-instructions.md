# RSVP System Test Instructions

## Current Status ✅
The RSVP system is **working correctly** based on console logs:
- User is authenticated
- Event data is loading
- No existing RSVPs (ready to create)

## How to Test RSVP Creation

1. **You're already on the event page** (`/communities/ahmetciler/events/tickett`)

2. **Click the RSVP button** in the free event card

3. **Select an option**:
   - **Going** - Confirms attendance
   - **Interested** - Shows interest
   - **Can't Go** - Declines

4. **Watch the console** for:
   ```
   [useRSVP] updateRSVP called
   [useRSVP] Upserting RSVP
   [useRSVP] Upsert response: {data: [...], error: null}
   [useRSVP] Status updated successfully: going
   ```

5. **Verify in UI**:
   - Toast notification appears
   - Button changes to show your status
   - Counts update (e.g., "1 going")

## What the Logs Mean

### Current logs show SUCCESS:
- `fetchRSVPData called` - Hook is initializing ✅
- `Event data response: {eventData: {...}, eventError: null}` - Event loaded ✅
- `No RSVP found for user, setting status to null` - Ready for first RSVP ✅

### After clicking RSVP:
- Should see `updateRSVP called` with your selection
- Should see `Upsert response` with success
- Button should update to show your status

## Troubleshooting

If RSVP doesn't work:
1. Make sure you're logged in (logs show you are)
2. Make sure event is free (metadata shows `is_free: true`)
3. Check for error messages in console after clicking

## Test Different Scenarios

1. **Change RSVP**: Click button again, select different option
2. **Cancel RSVP**: Select "Cancel RSVP" from dropdown
3. **Rate Limiting**: Try changing rapidly (>10 times in an hour)

## Success Indicators

✅ Toast notification appears
✅ Button shows your current status
✅ Counts update in real-time
✅ Console shows successful upsert
✅ No errors in console after action
