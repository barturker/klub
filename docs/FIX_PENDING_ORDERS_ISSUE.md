# Fix for Pending Orders Issue

## Problem Summary
All orders in the system were stuck in "pending" status and never transitioning to "paid" after successful Stripe payments.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Webhook Secret Configuration
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable was not configured
- Without this secret, Stripe webhooks cannot be verified and processed

### 2. Incomplete Webhook Handler Implementation
- The `checkout.session.completed` event handler was not properly implemented
- Orders were not being updated from "pending" to "paid" status
- Tickets were not being generated after successful payment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Webhook Handler (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)
- Added comprehensive `checkout.session.completed` event handling
- Updates order status to "paid" when payment succeeds
- Generates tickets automatically after payment confirmation
- Added extensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Created Test Infrastructure
- **Test Page** (`app/test/orders/page.tsx`): Comprehensive UI for testing order workflow
- **Simulate Webhook** (`app/api/test/simulate-webhook/route.ts`): Simulates webhook behavior for testing
- **Check Config** (`app/api/test/check-webhook-config/route.ts`): Verifies webhook configuration
- **Trigger Real Webhook** (`app/api/test/trigger-real-webhook/route.ts`): Tests actual webhook endpoint

### 3. Fixed Data Display Issues
- Fixed OrderStats component to handle undefined values
- Added safe number conversion and default values
- Fixed RPC function array extraction issue
- Added comprehensive debugging throughout the order system

## Configuration Required

### To Complete the Fix:

1. **Install Stripe CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   winget install Stripe.Stripe
   ```

2. **Login to Stripe**:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. **Start Webhook Forwarding**:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
   ```

4. **Copy the Webhook Signing Secret** displayed by the CLI (starts with `whsec_`)

5. **Add to `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
   ```

6. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing the Fix

### Method 1: Using Test Page
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test/orders
2. Check configuration status (should show "Configured" after setup)
3. Click "Simulate Webhook" on any pending order
4. Order should update to "paid" and ticket should be generated

### Method 2: Real Stripe Payment
1. Go to an event page
2. Click "Get Tickets"
3. Complete Stripe checkout with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
4. Order should automatically update to "paid" via webhook

## Key Files Modified

1. **app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts** - Main webhook handler
2. **components/orders/OrderStats.tsx** - Fixed undefined handling
3. **app/(dashboard)/communities/[slug]/orders/page.tsx** - Added debugging and fixed data fetching
4. **app/test/orders/page.tsx** - New test interface
5. **app/api/test/*** - Test endpoints for development

## Verification Steps

After configuration:
1. All new orders should transition from "pending" to "paid" after payment
2. Tickets should be automatically generated
3. Order stats should show correct revenue (only paid orders count)
4. No more undefined errors in OrderStats component

## Debug Information

The system now includes comprehensive debugging that logs:
- All webhook events received
- Order lookup and update operations
- Ticket generation
- Configuration status

Check the console output when running `npm run dev` to see detailed logs prefixed with:
- `[WEBHOOK DEBUG]` - Webhook processing
- `[ORDERS_DEBUG]` - Order fetching
- `[STATS_DEBUG]` - Statistics calculation
- `[WEBHOOK SIM]` - Simulation operations
