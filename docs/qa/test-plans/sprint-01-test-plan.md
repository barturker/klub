- [x] System Testing - End-to-end flows
- [ ] Acceptance Testing - After each story

### Test Types
- [x] Functional Testing - Core features
- [x] Security Testing - Auth and RLS
- [ ] Performance Testing - Not critical for MVP
- [x] Usability Testing - Basic UX flows

## Test Environment
**Stack:** Next.js 14 + Supabase + Vercel
**Browser Requirements:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+
**Node Version:** 18+
**Local Testing:** localhost:3000
**Staging:** Vercel preview deployments
