summary: |
  Significant progress made on TypeScript fixes:

  ✅ COMPLETED:
  - All Next.js 15 route handler signatures fixed
  - All "any" types eliminated
  - Type safety dramatically improved

  ⚠️ REMAINING:
  - Database type mismatches (requires schema sync)
  - Test infrastructure updates
  - Minor code cleanup tasks

  The codebase is now much more type-safe and Next.js 15 compatible.
  Remaining issues are primarily related to database schema synchronization
  and test infrastructure, not core application code.
