    - 'Run: npm test (all tests should pass)'
    - 'Verify no "any" types remain in codebase'

summary: |
  The TypeScript configuration has critical issues that prevent proper type checking
  and create potential runtime errors. The codebase needs immediate attention to:

  1. Update to Next.js 15 route handler patterns
  2. Eliminate all "any" types for proper type safety
  3. Fix test infrastructure
  4. Clean up code quality issues

  Total estimated fix time: 9-10 hours
  Recommended approach: Fix in order listed above as each builds on the previous
