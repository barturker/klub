# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Enable community organizers to generate sustainable revenue** through integrated ticketing, memberships, and course sales within their mobile communities
- **Reduce administrative overhead by 10+ hours per week** by consolidating fragmented tools into one seamless platform
- **Achieve product-market fit within 6 months** with 1,000 active communities processing $3M in annual transaction volume
- **Deliver a mobile-first experience** that members actually use daily, achieving 60% weekly active member rate
- **Maintain platform economics** that work for both organizers and klub, with 3-5% transaction fees avoiding App Store IAP requirements
- **Create network effects** where each successful community attracts more organizers and members organically
- **Build defensible moat** through integrated features that become painful to unbundle once adopted

## Background Context

The creator economy is exploding toward $528 billion by 2030, yet community organizers still juggle 5-7 different tools to manage their operations â€” Facebook Groups for discussions, Eventbrite for ticketing, Stripe for payments, WhatsApp for communication. This fragmentation costs organizers 10-15 hours weekly in administrative overhead and causes 30-40% revenue loss from payment friction. klub solves this by providing an all-in-one mobile platform where community building meets seamless monetization.

Our Project Brief validated that physical event tickets and in-person services qualify as "physical goods" under Apple App Store Guidelines 3.1.5(a), allowing us to use external payment processors without Apple's 30% commission. This enables a sustainable business model with 3-5% transaction fees while delivering 10x value to organizers through time savings and revenue growth. The MVP focuses on professional organizers already generating $2K-50K monthly who need better tools, and aspiring creators ready to monetize their first communities.
