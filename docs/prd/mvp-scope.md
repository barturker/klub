## MVP Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs (Month 3):
- 100 active communities
- 5,000 total members
- $50,000 in processed transactions
- 40% weekly active rate

### Secondary KPIs:
- <3 minute community setup time
- <30 second event creation
- 80% organizer retention (month 2)
- 4.5+ app store rating (PWA feedback)

## MVP Technology Decisions

### Simplified Stack:
- **Frontend:** React Native Web (PWA first)
- **Backend:** NestJS + GraphQL
- **Database:** PostgreSQL only (Phase 1)
- **Auth:** AWS Cognito
- **Payments:** Stripe Connect
- **Hosting:** AWS with auto-scaling

### Deferred Decisions:
- Native mobile apps (use PWA initially)
- Redis caching (add at 5000+ sessions)
- MongoDB analytics (add at 1M events/day)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **App Store Rejection:** Start with PWA, validate payment model
- **Scaling Issues:** PostgreSQL handles 10K users easily
- **Performance:** Implement caching strategy early

### Business Risks:
- **Low Adoption:** Focus on 10 pilot communities first
- **Payment Disputes:** Clear refund policy, Stripe protection
- **Competition:** Fast iteration, unique integrations
