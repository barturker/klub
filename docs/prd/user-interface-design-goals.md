# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The klub interface embodies "powerful simplicity" â€” sophisticated functionality wrapped in an intuitive, mobile-first design that feels as natural as social media but as robust as professional tools. The experience should feel premium yet approachable, giving organizers confidence they're using a professional platform while members enjoy a consumer-grade social experience. Every interaction should reinforce trust through smooth animations, instant feedback, and reliable performance. The design language balances community warmth with business credibility.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Swipe-First Navigation:** Primary actions accessible via swipes and gestures, minimizing button taps
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex features revealed gradually as users need them, preventing overwhelm
- **Contextual Actions:** Smart suggestions and shortcuts based on user behavior and role
- **Unified Timeline:** Single feed combining events, posts, and announcements with smart filtering
- **Quick Actions:** Floating action button adapts to context (create event, post, announcement)
- **Inline Editing:** Edit-in-place for all content without navigation to separate screens
- **Visual Feedback:** Haptic feedback, micro-animations, and progress indicators for all actions
- **Smart Defaults:** Pre-filled forms based on previous entries and common patterns

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full WCAG AA compliance including screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode, adjustable font sizes, and clear focus indicators. All interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes (44x44pt) with sufficient spacing.

## Branding

Clean, modern aesthetic with customizable accent colors per community. Default klub brand uses trust-building blues with energetic orange accents. Typography emphasizes readability with SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android. Communities can upload logos and choose from preset color themes, maintaining consistent component styling while allowing brand expression.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

- **Primary:** Native iOS and Android apps optimized for phones (iPhone 12+ size as baseline)
- **Secondary:** Responsive web app for organizer administration and member desktop access
- **Tablet:** Adaptive layouts for iPad/Android tablets, not separate apps
