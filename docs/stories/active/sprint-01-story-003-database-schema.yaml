  epic: "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure"
  priority: "P0-Critical"
  points: 3
  sprint: "Sprint 1"
  status: "Completed"

user_story:
  as_a: "developer"
  i_want: "a properly structured database schema"
  so_that: "I can store and retrieve all application data efficiently"

acceptance_criteria:
  - given: "I access Supabase SQL editor"
    when: "I run the schema creation script"
    then: "All tables are created without errors"
  - given: "Tables are created"
    when: "I check the structure"
    then: "All required columns and relationships exist"
  - given: "RLS is required"
    when: "I check table policies"
    then: "Row Level Security is enabled with proper policies"
  - given: "I need to test the schema"
    when: "I insert test data"
    then: "Data is stored and retrieved correctly"
  - given: "Users sign up"
    when: "A new auth user is created"
    then: "A profile is automatically generated"

technical_notes:
  - "Use UUID for all primary keys"

test_scenarios:
  - scenario: "Schema creation"
    steps:
      - "Drop all tables if exist"
      - "Run schema SQL script"
      - "Check Supabase dashboard"
    expected: "All tables created with correct structure"
  - scenario: "RLS policies"
    steps:
      - "Try to read communities as anonymous"
      - "Try to read as authenticated user"
      - "Try to write as non-owner"
    expected: "Policies enforce correct access control"
  - scenario: "Data insertion"
    steps:
      - "Insert a community"
      - "Insert an event for that community"
      - "Insert a ticket purchase"
    expected: "All data saved with proper relationships"
  - scenario: "Cascade deletion"
    steps:
      - "Create community with events"
      - "Delete the community"
    expected: "Related events are also deleted"
  - scenario: "Type generation"
    steps:
      - "Run supabase gen types"
      - "Import in TypeScript file"
    expected: "Full type safety with IntelliSense"
