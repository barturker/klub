    // Initialize Dinero.js with currencies
    import { dinero, add, subtract, multiply, divide, toUnit } from 'dinero.js';
    import { TRY, USD, EUR, JPY } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

    // Create money objects (amounts in minor units - kuruş/cents)
    const ticketPrice = dinero({ amount: 10000, currency: TRY }); // 100.00 TRY
    const usdPrice = dinero({ amount: 5000, currency: USD }); // 50.00 USD
    const jpyPrice = dinero({ amount: 5000, currency: JPY }); // 5000 JPY (no decimals)

    // Platform fee calculation (3%)
    const platformFee = multiply(ticketPrice, { amount: 3, scale: 2 }); // 3.00 TRY

    // Stripe fee (2.9% + 30 kuruş)
    const stripeFeePercentage = multiply(ticketPrice, { amount: 29, scale: 3 }); // 2.90 TRY
    const stripeFeeFixed = dinero({ amount: 30, currency: TRY }); // 0.30 TRY
    const totalStripeFee = add(stripeFeePercentage, stripeFeeFixed); // 3.20 TRY

    // Group discount (10% off for 5+ tickets)
    const groupDiscount = multiply(ticketPrice, { amount: 10, scale: 2 }); // 10.00 TRY
    const discountedPrice = subtract(ticketPrice, groupDiscount); // 90.00 TRY

    // VAT calculation (18% KDV)
    const vat = multiply(ticketPrice, { amount: 18, scale: 2 }); // 18.00 TRY
    const priceWithVat = add(ticketPrice, vat); // 118.00 TRY

    // Proration for refunds (5 days of 30-day event)
    const dailyRate = divide(ticketPrice, 30); // 3.33 TRY per day
    const refundAmount = multiply(dailyRate, 5); // 16.65 TRY

    // Format for display
    const displayPrice = toUnit(ticketPrice); // 100
    const formattedPrice = toUnit(ticketPrice).toFixed(2); // "100.00"

    // Multi-currency conversion (example rate: 1 USD = 32 TRY)
    const convertToTRY = (usdAmount) => {
      return multiply(usdAmount, { amount: 3200, scale: 2 });
    };

    // Immutable operations (original unchanged)

    console.log(toUnit(original)); // Still 100.00

  potential_issues:
    - "Currency conversion - use Dinero.js with fixed rates or external API integration"
    - "Concurrent ticket purchases - use database locks with Dinero.js for consistency"
    - "Discount code abuse - implement rate limiting"
    - "Fee calculation - ensure transparency using Dinero.js immutable operations"
    - "Minor unit conversion - ensure proper handling per currency (TRY=2, JPY=0, KWD=3)"
