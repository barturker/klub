# Story 2.3: Member Profile System

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** community member,
**I want** to create and manage my profile,
**so that** other community members can know who I am and connect with me

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When I sign up for the platform, a basic profile is automatically created with my email
2. When I access profile settings, I can add name, bio, location, interests, and social links
3. When I click on avatar upload, I can upload, crop, and save my profile image
4. When I set my profile to private, other members only see basic information (name and avatar)
5. When I save changes, updates are reflected immediately across all communities

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Changes

The profiles table needs to be extended with the following columns:
- `display_name` (text) - User's display name
- `bio` (text) - User biography/description
- `avatar_url` (text) - Profile picture URL
- `location` (text) - User location
- `interests` (text[]) - Array of user interests
- `social_links` (jsonb) - JSON object for social media links
- `privacy_level` (text) - Privacy setting with CHECK constraint for values: 'public', 'members_only', 'private'
- `profile_complete` (boolean) - Profile completion flag
- `last_active` (timestamptz) - Last activity timestamp
- `member_since` (timestamptz) - Member registration date
- `metadata` (jsonb) - Additional flexible data storage

Indexes needed:
- `idx_profiles_display_name` on display_name for search
- `idx_profiles_interests` using GIN on interests array for filtering

### API Endpoints Structure

All endpoints follow Next.js App Router pattern in `/app/api/` directory:

1. **GET /api/profile** - Returns current authenticated user's profile with completion percentage
2. **GET /api/profile/[id]** - Returns specific user profile respecting privacy settings
3. **PATCH /api/profile** - Updates profile fields, only sends modified fields
4. **POST /api/profile/avatar** - Handles avatar upload with crop data
5. **POST /api/profile/complete** - Calculates and returns completion status

### Component Architecture

Components should be organized under `/components/profile/`:
- `ProfileForm.tsx` - Main form using React Hook Form with Zod validation
- `AvatarUpload.tsx` - Uses react-easy-crop (already in project) for image cropping
- `ProfileCard.tsx` - Reusable profile summary component
- `ProfileCompletionBar.tsx` - Visual progress indicator
- `InterestsSelector.tsx` - Tag-based input using existing UI components

Page location: `/app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx` following dashboard layout structure

### Image Handling

Use the existing `react-easy-crop` library (v5.5.0) that's already implemented in:
- `/components/ui/image-upload.tsx`
- `/components/community/CoverUpload.tsx`
- `/components/community/LogoUpload.tsx`

Follow the same pattern for consistency. Do NOT add react-avatar-editor.

### Interest Tags

Instead of adding react-tag-input, use the existing component patterns with:
- Combobox from shadcn/ui for selection
- Badge components for display
- Input with custom tag logic similar to existing implementations

### Required Libraries

Only one new library needed:
- `date-fns` (v4.1.0) - Already in package.json for date formatting

### Supabase Integration

- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies for profile access control
- Store avatars in Supabase Storage with public bucket
- Implement real-time subscriptions for profile updates if needed
- Use generated types from `lib/supabase/types.ts`

### Performance Considerations

- Profile load time target: <500ms
- Avatar upload time target: <2s for 5MB image
- Profile update response target: <300ms
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use optimistic updates for better UX

### Security Requirements

- Sanitize all text inputs (bio, location) for XSS
- Validate image uploads (type: JPG/PNG only, max size: 5MB)
- Enforce privacy settings at database level with RLS
- Rate limit profile updates: max 10 per hour
- Never expose email in public profiles

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test files location: `__tests__/` directories colocated with components
- Use Jest and React Testing Library (already configured)
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new components
- E2E tests using Playwright in `/tests/e2e/`

### Required Tests
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - ProfileCompletionBar percentage calculation
   - Privacy level enforcement logic
   - Avatar crop coordinate validation

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Complete profile setup flow
   - Profile update with validation
   - Avatar upload and storage

3. **E2E Tests:**
   - New user profile creation
   - Profile editing journey
   - Privacy settings verification
