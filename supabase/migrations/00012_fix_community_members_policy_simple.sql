-- Migration: Simple Fix for community_members RLS
-- Version: 00012
-- Created: 2025-01-12
-- Description: Minimal fix - just remove the problematic policy
-- =============================================

-- The error says: "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation community_members"
-- So we need to find and fix ONLY the recursive policy

-- First, drop ALL existing policies on community_members to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View community members" ON community_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Join public communities" ON community_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organizers update members" ON community_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Leave or remove members" ON community_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Members can view community members" ON community_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can leave communities" ON community_members;

-- Create a VERY SIMPLE policy just for testing
-- This allows users to see their own memberships only (no recursion possible)
CREATE POLICY "Users see own memberships only"
ON community_members
FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Allow users to join communities (simple version)
CREATE POLICY "Users can join"
ON community_members
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Allow users to leave (delete their own membership)
CREATE POLICY "Users can leave"
ON community_members
FOR DELETE
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- This should fix the immediate issue
-- We can add more complex policies later once this works
